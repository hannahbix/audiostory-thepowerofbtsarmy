			<p> <b>HANNAH BOTTUM:</b> I’m Hannah Bottum for New York City News. What do boy bands, grandmas on Facebook, and Black Lives Matter have in common? But first: a hint. Sound courtesy of the United Nations.</p>

			<p> <b>CHEERING:</b> BTS! BTS! BTS! </p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> Did you guess? It’s fans of the Korean pop group BTS, known as ARMY. ARMY is not your “typical” boy band fandom. It’s uniquely diverse, global, and quick to mobilize on behalf of social justice. Fan pages across the internet are essential to this. Jackie Rojas runs a Twitter handle with more than 700,000 followers.</p>

			<p> <b>JACKIE ROJAS:</b> And I thought, you know, what a cool idea, to get involved and to meet other people that have similar interests to mine.</p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> ARMY is active on Facebook, Tumblr, and other platforms, too. Carrie Boe runs OneLuvBTS, a Facebook page with more than 3,000 followers.</p>

			<p> <b>CARRIE BOE:</b> There’s this community, where folks can kind of come together, and have kind of similar thoughts, and, you know, we start to see a lot of the same names engaging and commenting. And they want that - that connection. </p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> Connection to other fans is part of what makes ARMY special. Bea [BEE] Vantapool works at Tumblr, where she focuses on K-pop fan pages. She agrees it’s a unique community.</p>

			<p> <b>BEA VANTAPOOL:</b> No matter what, um, ethnicity, you are, where you come from, what language you speak. You can be in ARMY. They will accept you, they will love you, and sort of like, welcome you into this family.</p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> It’s a multigenerational family, too.</p>

			<p> <b>BEA:</b> I have an aunt, and she’s like, in her fifties, and she loves BTS. I have a cousin, who is like six years old, and she loves BTS.</p>

			<p> <b>CARRIE:</b> We’ve got younger folks, we’ve got 80-something year old grandmas about how much they love them, and how they just want to hug them and bake them cookies. </p>

			<p> <b>JACKIE:</b> The one thing that is a constant is that they are super compassionate. </p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> This compassion translates into action. BTS fan  pages regularly raise money for social issues. Bea says this was especially powerful during last year’s Black Lives Matter protests.</p>

			<p> <b>BEA:</b> Donald Trump was President, and just spewing racist garbage. And everyone was like, you know, it’s time to stand up and really say something.</p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> For Carrie, this issue was especially close to home. </p>

			<p> <b>CARRIE:</b> I’m in Minneapolis. So last spring, with George Floyd’s murder and all of that. You know, we were in the thick of it.</p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> It took ARMY approximately 24 hours to match a million dollar donation from BTS to Black Lives Matter. </p>

			<p> <b>CARRIE:</b> That’s pretty powerful stuff.</p>

			<p> <b>HANNAH:</b> One thing is clear: don’t underestimate the power of the BTS ARMY. For New York City News, I’m Hannah Bottum.</p>
